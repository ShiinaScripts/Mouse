- Small mouse

Pretty cool mouse, overall I really like it in short useages.  
When I got it I had to open it in order to stretch out a spring. This is because the switch was even more mushy than normal. Seen a couple of reported issues similar to this, I was probably just unlucky.

My main issue with this mouse is just the swithces and I'm not alone with this. The switches  are some razer special optical switches which sound cool in theory because **"They should never double click"**, which is fair, I haven't experienced that so it's probably working.  
The switches feel hollow while also being harder to press than I'd like. It's just missing the crispyness that other mice have.

I really like the design of the mouse, how it looks. The buttons wiggle a little but if you attempt to, so basically not mattering.

Huge plus is that it doesn't have holes
