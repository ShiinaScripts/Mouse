# Mouse
Self contained mouse madness

This is where I'll put all my thoughts etc about all the mice I own.  
I'm not gonna put dimensions and other information that's easily available other places such as reddit or [Gearsearch](https://gearsearch.gg)

*notes*
- I don't care much for the cable
- I don't use a bungee
- I just have room on my desk for a cable to exist and it works
- This will be **MY OPINION** therefore most things will be negative
